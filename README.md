# GENE-SWitCH project RNA-Seq analysis pipeline

## Requirements

The following dependencies are required:

- [Nextflow 19.10.0](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/getstarted.html)
- [FastQC 0.11.8](https://github.com/s-andrews/FastQC)
- [Cutadapt 2.7](https://cutadapt.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html)
- [Trim Galore 0.6.5](https://github.com/FelixKrueger/TrimGalore)
- [STAR 2.7.3a](https://github.com/alexdobin/STAR)
- [StringTie 2.0.5](https://github.com/gpertea/stringtie)

## Usage

Execute this nextflow pipeline with:

```bash
./run rnaseq.nf --outdir <output directory> \
                --reads <reads1.fq> <reads2.fq> \
                --genome <genome.fa> \
                --annotation <annotation.gff> \
                [nextflow arguments]
```

Using the `./run` wrapper script instead of the `nextflow run` command provides several benefits:
- All results and temporary files are written to the output directory, keeping the execution directory clean.
- All temporary files are deleted once the pipeline has successfully completed.
- The pipeline can be resumed from any directory with nextflow's `-resume` option.
- The pipeline's arguments are parsed in accordance with the GNU conventions.
