# GENE-SWitCH project RNA-Seq analysis pipeline


## Installation

To use this pipeline, simply clone or download this repository, and install the dependencies:

- [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/getstarted.html) >= 20.01.0
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) >= 19.03.2 or [Singularity](https://sylabs.io/guides/3.5/user-guide/quick_start.html) >= 3.4


## Usage

Execute this nextflow pipeline with:

    ./nextflow-run proj-gs-rna-seq [arguments]

The `./nextflow-run` launcher script replaces the `nextflow run` command and grants these benefits:
- Options can receive multiple space-separated parameters and unquoted globs.
- Long options are preceded by double dashes, following GNU conventions.
- Temporary files and logs are written to the output directory, keeping the execution directory clean.
- Temporary files are deleted after the pipeline has successfully completed.
- The pipeline can be resumed from any directory with the `--resume` option.

### Arguments

| Option | Parameter(s) | Description | Requirement |
|--------|--------------|-------------|-------------|
| __`--profile`__ | `<profile1>` `<profile2>` `...` | Profile(s) to use when<br>running the pipeline.<br>Specify the profiles that<br>fit your infrastructure<br>among `singularity`,<br>`docker`, `kubernetes`,<br>`slurm`. | Required |

| __`--annotation`__ | `<annotation.gff>` | Input reference<br>annotation file. | Required |
| __`--genome`__ | `<genome.fa>` | Input genome<br>sequence file. | Required if `fastq`<br>files are provided<br>and `--index` is<br>absent. |
| __`--index`__ | `<directory>` | Input genome index<br>directory. Overrides<br>`--genome`. | Required if `fastq`<br>files are provided<br>and `--genome` is<br>absent. |
| __`--metadata`__ | `<metadata.tsv>` | Input tabulated<br>metadata file. | Required if `--merge`<br>is provided. |
| __`--merge`__ | `<factor1>` `<factor2>` `...` | Factor(s) to merge<br>mapped reads. See<br>the [merge factors](https://github.com/FAANG/proj-gs-rna-seq#merge-factors)<br>section for details. | Optional |
| __`--max-cpus`__ | `<16>` | Maximum number of<br>CPU cores that can be<br>used for each process.<br>This is a limit, not the<br>actual number of<br>requested CPU cores. | Optional |
| __`--max-memory`__ | `<64GB>` | Maximum memory that<br>can be used for each<br>process. This is a limit,<br>not the actual amount<br>of alloted memory. | Optional |
| __`--max-time`__ | `<12h>` | Maximum time that can<br>be spent on each<br>process. This is a limit<br>and has no effect on the<br>duration of each process.| Optional |
| __`--resume`__ | | Resume the pipeline after<br>an interruption. Previously<br>completed processes will<br>be skipped. | Optional |
| __`--keep-temp`__ | | Do not delete temporary<br>files upon completion. | Optional |

### Merge factors

Use the `--merge` and `--metadata` options together to merge mapped reads. This results in genes and transcripts being quantified by __factors__ rather than by __inputs__.

The metadata file consists of tab-separated values describing your inputs. The first column must contain file names without extensions. There is no restriction on column names or number of columns.

#### Examples

Given the following tabulated metadata file:

    input    diet      tissue
    A        corn      liver
    B        corn      liver
    C        wheat     liver
    D        wheat     muscle

With the following arguments:

    --reads A_R1.fq A_R2.fq B.fq C.fq D.bam --metadata metadata.tsv --merge diet

- __A__ and __B__ mapped reads will be merged, resulting in gene and transcript counts for the __corn__ diet.
- __C__ and __D__ mapped reads will be merged, resulting in gene and transcript counts for the __wheat__ diet.

With the following arguments:

    --reads A_R1.fq A_R2.fq B.fq C.fq D.bam --metadata metadata.tsv --merge diet tissue

- __A__ and __B__ mapped reads will be merged, resulting in gene and transcript counts for the __corn__ diet and __liver__ tissue pair.
- __C__ mapped reads will be left alone, resulting in gene and transcript counts for the __wheat__ diet and __liver__ tissue pair.
- __D__ mapped reads will be left alone, resulting in gene and transcript counts for the __wheat__ diet and __muscle__ tissue pair.


## Workflow

The pipeline executes the following processes:
1. Control reads __quality__ with [FastQC](https://github.com/s-andrews/FastQC).  
   Outputs quality reports to `output/quality/raw`.
2. __Trim__ adaptators from reads with [Trim Galore](https://github.com/FelixKrueger/TrimGalore).  
   Outputs quality reports to `output/quality/trimmed`.
3. Estimate __overhang__ length of splice junctions, and __index__ the genome sequence with [STAR](https://github.com/alexdobin/STAR).  
   Outputs indexed genome to `output/index`.
4. __Map__ reads to indexed genome with [STAR](https://github.com/alexdobin/STAR).  
   Outputs mapped reads to `output/maps`.
5. Estimate __direction__ and __length__ of mapped reads, and compute genome __coverage__ with [Bedtools](https://github.com/arq5x/bedtools2).  
   Outputs bedGraph files to `output/coverage`.
6. __Merge__ mapped reads by factors with [Samtools](https://github.com/samtools/samtools).  
   See the [merge factors](#merge-factors) section for details.
7. __Assemble__ transcripts and __combine__ them into a new assembly annotation with [StringTie](https://github.com/gpertea/stringtie).  
   Outputs the new assembly annotation to `output/assembly`.
8. __Quantify__ genes and transcripts with [StringTie](https://github.com/gpertea/stringtie), and __format__ them into tabulated files.  
   Outputs TPM values and read counts to `output/quantification` for the reference and assembly annotations.
